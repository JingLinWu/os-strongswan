Description: IPsec VPN solution metapackage
 The strongSwan VPN suite uses the native IPsec stack in the standard Linux
 kernel. It supports both the IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This metapackage installs the packages required to maintain IKEv1 and IKEv2
 connections via ipsec.conf or ipsec.secrets.

Description: strongSwan utility and crypto library
 The strongSwan VPN suite uses the native IPsec stack in the standard
 Linux kernel. It supports both the IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This package provides the underlying library of charon and other strongSwan
 components. It is built in a modular way and is extendable through various
 plugins.

Description: strongSwan library and binaries - debugging symbols
 The strongSwan VPN suite uses the native IPsec stack in the standard
 Linux kernel. It supports both the IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This package provides the symbols needed for debugging of strongSwan.

Description: strongSwan daemon starter and configuration file parser
 The strongSwan VPN suite uses the native IPsec stack in the standard
 Linux kernel. It supports both the IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 The starter and the associated "ipsec" script control the charon daemon from
 the command line. It parses ipsec.conf and loads the configurations to the
 daemon.

Description: strongSwan Internet Key Exchange (v2) daemon
 The strongSwan VPN suite uses the native IPsec stack in the standard
 Linux kernel. It supports both the IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 charon is an IPsec IKEv2 daemon. It is written from scratch using a fully
 multi-threaded design and a modular architecture. Various plugins provide
 additional functionality.

Recommends: network-manager-strongswan
Description: strongSwan plugin to interact with NetworkManager
 The strongSwan VPN suite uses the native IPsec stack in the standard
 Linux kernel. It supports both the IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This plugin provides an interface which allows NetworkManager to configure
 and control the IKEv2 daemon directly through D-Bus. It is designed to work
 in conjunction with the network-manager-strongswan package, providing
 a simple graphical frontend to configure IPsec based VPNs.

Description: strongSwan IKEv1 daemon, transitional package
 The strongSwan VPN suite uses the native IPsec stack in the standard
 Linux kernel. It supports both the IKEv1 and IKEv2 protocols.
 .
 This package used to install the pluto daemon, implementing the IKEv1
 protocol. It has been replaced by charon in the strongswan-ike package, so
 this package can be safely removed once it's installed.
