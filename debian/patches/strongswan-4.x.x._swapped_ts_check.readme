Fixes a Denial-of-Service vulnerability where receiving a malformed IKE_AUTH request
with either a missing TSi or TSr traffic selector payload causes a crash of the
IKEv2 charon while dereferencing a NULL pointer because the NULL pointer checks
of TSi and TSr before destruction were erroneously swapped.

Apply to strongSwan releases 4.1.0 to 4.3.0
