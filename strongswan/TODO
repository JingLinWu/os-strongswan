                  strongSwan - Roadmap
                 -------------------------

These notes mostly belong to charon, the new IKEv2 daemon. The plan is to
migrate IKEv1 into charon. It's hard to say how much effort is needed to
do that, and how much code we can reuse from pluto. But a port IS necessary to
gain hassle-free configuration, version negotiation and maintainability.
