 *
 * An EAP method initiates an EAP exchange and processes requests and
 * responses. An EAP method may need multiple exchanges before succeeding, and
 * the eap_authentication may use multiple EAP methods to authenticate a peer.
 * To accomplish these requirements, all EAP methods have their own
 * implementation while the eap_authenticatior uses one or more of these
 * EAP methods. Sending of EAP(SUCCESS/FAILURE) message is not the job
 * of the method, the eap_authenticator does this.
 * An EAP method may establish a MSK, this is used the complete the
 * authentication. Even if a mutual EAP method is used, the traditional
 * AUTH payloads are required. Only these include the nonces and messages from
 * ike_sa_init and therefore prevent man in the middle attacks.
